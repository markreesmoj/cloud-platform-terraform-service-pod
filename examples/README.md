# Examples

The configuration in this directory creates a service pod.

This example is designed to be used in the [cloud-platform-environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/) repository.

## Usage

In the cloud-platform-environments repository, in your namespace path, create a directory called `resources` (if there isn't one already) and refer to the contents of [service-pod.tf](service-pod.tf) to define the module variables.

The top-level README in this repository also refers to other variables you can set to further customise your resource.

Commit your changes to a branch and raise a pull request. Once approved, you can merge and the changes will be applied.
